                <h3>Entrepreneurship</h3>
                <p>Working for myself has always interested me. In the future I hope to follow in the steps of other great entrepreneurs in influencing the way the world works.</p>

                <h3>Technology</h3>
                <p>The development of technology and its impact on human life is a huge part of what I like to study. In particular I love developments in computer vision and biotechnology.</p>

                <h3>Writing</h3>
                <p>In addition to writing code, I often squeeze in the time to write fiction and poetry myself. Writing eases stress and is a great way to express oneself. My favorite writer is Jorge Borges.</p>

                <h3>Philosophy</h3>
                <p>Reading what people have thought about the human condition and its desire for meaning is always entertaining to me. Some of my favorite philosophers are Nitche, Camus, Kafka and Dostoyevsky.</p>

                <h3>Psychology</h3>
                <p>Understanding how the human mind works is something that I've always wanted to be able to do. Psychology has provided an wonderfully amazing and oftentimes counterintutive perspective on this subject.</p>

                <p>I have always loved composing and taking photos. In fact, all of the photos on this page of my site are originals.</p>

                <h3>Art</h3>
                <p>Art is a vague term for a part of humanity that I don't think I'll ever understand. Maybe two kids in NYC should have better things to do than go to art museums.</p>

                <h3>Design</h3>
                <p>The way everything we create is designed is something that I have been studying in every different form of art for the past few years.</p>

                <h3>Manufacturing</h3>
                <p>Sometimes it is not enough to just design something. How things are actually produced and enter the market is a huge topic of interest.</p>

                <h3>Economics</h3>
                <p>The way the world works is often full of humans, and often full of mistakes as a result. Figuring out how to model these mistakes and perhaps how to see through them and predict them is at the core of economics.</p>

                <h3>Medicine</h3>
                <p>Biology, chemistry, technology and their intersection in medicine are of great interest to me. With new developments in medicine, the scale of life can change dramatically; and I hope to be one of the developers pushing it forward. I used to want to go to med school, if you could believe it.</p>
