                <p>Developed predictive risk management framework looking to streamline unstructured operational risk event data (continuity of business reports, money laundering reports, etc.) analysis using natural language processing and text analytics based clustering. A secondary goal of this project was to make this scalable to an international level.</p>
                <p>Created a method for restructuring each lengthy risk event report into an array of key terms that identify the event’s time of occurrence, region of impact, defining phrases and other useful attributes. This restructuring was then leveraged for document clustering so as to link possibly connected events throughout the company to identify overarching risks that would otherwise be difficult/impossible for people to do. It also was used for time series analysis of the frequency of defining phrases on a quarterly and monthly basis, presenting a possible predictive metric for risk events in upcoming time periods or even a way of quality controlling new policy impact on risk events. The risk dashboard was developed to allow this type of analysis for any combination of parameters (region, organization, etc.) the risk managers chose.</p>
                <p>Successfully presented and pitched the new framework to senior level chief risk officers and implemented expanded risk dashboard capabilities for risk manager use on an international company-wide scale.</p>
